ValvePCF is a Python library for parsing .pcf files for the Source Engine. It provides ways to read, modify and write pcf files.

.. note:: The structure of a Pcf files is twofold. There's the data structure, and the data schema. This Library currently only assists with the data structure. To create new data in your pcf files, you'll need to know what you are doing or find pcf schema information somewhere. This Project is not opposed to supporting schemas in the future but the project is not there yet.
